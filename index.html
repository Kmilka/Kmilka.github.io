      <p>&emsp; Last year I managed IT-part of a start-up project on blockchain. There I took over coordination of the dev-team including integration with several web-services. My duties were not limited to, so I acted as a backup for all team members when needed. For example, I created functional UX-design with Figma or wrote unit tests with python. Also, I enjoyed myself doing the optimization of the company's business processes and the organization of team-building events.

       &emsp; I gained a strong analytical background after 2 years in Glowbyte, where I helped 2 Russian banks to obtain insights and optimize everyday processes through BI-tools and loads of data from the Data warehouses. I have a strong understanding of data modeling concepts and independent skills with SQL, which I used to prototype financial reports for governmental regulations and top management usage. All reports visualized in Power BI and Tableau, so I understand how to operate there. I needed to read ETL-schemes to detect non-compliance with the requirements written with SQL. Moreover, I have an innate talent to see a big picture and work with people in an effective still cordial way with attention to detail.
